:construction: *Still under construction - the very basics are set* :construction:

This very basic and simple text-based game is created for the command line to practice the basics of C#.

## Features
- The game has a starting screen
- The game has different branches to where the story can go, so choices can be made by the player
- ASCII art is used to visualize what is happening
- At the end of the game, there's summary of which decisions and items the player has found. They're congratulated when they've chosen a specific item during the game.

## Improvements
- The code is now in 1 file, should be refactored
- The story is very short, should be expanded

## Credits
